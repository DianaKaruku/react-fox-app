# REACT FOX APP
by DIANA KARUKU

# Introduction
This React Fox App is a simple web application that allows users to explore fox-related content through different components. Here's a summary of each component's functionality:

# App.js
The main component of the application, App.js, utilizes the React Router to define routes for four sections: Home (FoxImage), Comments, AddImage, and FoxFacts. Each route is associated with a specific component.

# NavBar.js
The NavBar component provides navigation links using Link components for Home, Comments, Add Image, and Fox Facts.

# FoxImage.js
The FoxImage component fetches a random fox image from the Random Fox API and displays it after a button click.

# AddImage.js
The AddImage component allows the user to upload an image. It includes a file input and an "Upload" button.

# Comments.js
The Comments component allows users to add comments. It includes a textarea for entering comments and a button to add the comment to the list.
